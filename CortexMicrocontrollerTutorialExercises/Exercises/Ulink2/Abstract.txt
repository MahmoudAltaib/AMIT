The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - character LCD display shows
   - init message
   - bargraph (depending on potentiometer position)
 - AD conversion is done in DMA mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1 
   - USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F103 OPT:      STM32F103 with Flash Options
                      (used for programming)

  STM32F103 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)

  STM32F103 Trace A:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip and is
                      configured for Trace (shows variables AD_DbgVal, 
                      \IRQ\SysTick_Hanlder\ticks and SFR USART1_DR in
                      Logic Analyzer)

  STM32F103 Trace B:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip and is
                      configured for Trace (shows only SFR USART1_DR
                      in Logic Analyzer including the first character in
                      packet which is followed very fast by the second
                      due to the UART HW transmit buffer)

  STM32F103 Trace C:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip and is
                      configured for Trace (shows variables AD_DbgVal, 
                      \IRQ\SysTick_Hanlder\ticks in Logic Analyzer and
                      the ITM printf output in the Serial-Wire Viewer)
