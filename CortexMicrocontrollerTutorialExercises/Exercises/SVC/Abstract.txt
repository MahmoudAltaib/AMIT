The SVC project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

The SVC project shows how to implement and use software interrupt functions.
It includes the SVC.c file which implements the SVC handler.
The SVC function declarations and implementations are demonstrated
in the file Test.c


The SVC program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F103 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
